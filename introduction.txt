Welcome to Manta Ray on Ocean Protocol - a sandbox environment to test the latest developments in Ocean Protocol!

Currently, Manta Ray provides several Jupyter Notebooks to help you get started with Ocean Protocol.

JupyterLab is an open source IPython environment that runs in the browser. 

JupyterLab can be run on your local machine, or in this case, it is hosted on a virtual machine on the cloud. 

The VM git-clones the latest example scripts found in the Ocean Protocol mantaray project, designed by data scientists, for data scientists.

When prompted for a login at the below link, type any string for a username, and no password.

(At a later date, more authentication will be required, but for now, enjoy the free sandbox to explore Ocean Protocol!).
